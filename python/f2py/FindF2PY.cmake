#
# The purpose of the F2PY –Fortran to Python interface generator– project is to provide a
# connection between Python and Fortran languages.
#
# F2PY is a Python package (with a command line tool f2py and a module f2py2e) that facilitates
# creating/building Python C/API extension modules that make it possible to call Fortran 77/90/95
# external subroutines and Fortran 90/95 module subroutines as well as C functions; to access Fortran
# 77 COMMON blocks and Fortran 90/95 module data, including allocatable arrays from Python.
#
# For more information on the F2PY project, see http://www.f2py.com/.
#
# The following variables are defined:
#
# ::
#
#   F2PY_EXECUTABLE      - absolute path to the F2PY executable
#
# ::
#
#   F2PY_VERSION_STRING  - the version of F2PY found
#   F2PY_VERSION_MAJOR   - the F2PY major version
#   F2PY_VERSION_MINOR   - the F2PY minor version
#   F2PY_VERSION_PATCH   - the F2PY patch version
#
#
# .. note::
#
#   By default, the module finds the F2PY program associated with the installed NumPy package.
#

# Path to the f2py executable

## We might have an odd circumstance where there are a couple f2py around. As such,
## we need to find the one that matches the Python_EXECUTABLE. This is a bit of a
## hack, but it should work for most cases.

## Find the directory where the Python_EXECUTABLE is located

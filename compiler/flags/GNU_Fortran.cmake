# GCC 10 changed behavior in how it handles Fortran. To wit:

#   Mismatches between actual and dummy argument lists in a single file are
#   now rejected with an error. Use the new option -fallow-argument-mismatch
#   to turn these errors into warnings; this option is implied with
#   -std=legacy. -Wargument-mismatch has been removed.

#   The handling of a BOZ literal constant has been reworked to provide
#   better conformance to the Fortran 2008 and 2018 standards. In these
#   Fortran standards, a BOZ literal constant is a typeless and kindless
#   entity. As a part of the rework, documented and undocumented extensions
#   to the Fortran standard now emit errors during compilation. Some of
#   these extensions are permitted with the -fallow-invalid-boz, where the
#   error is degraded to a warning and the code is compiled as with older
#   gfortran.

# GEOS has many places where, if not converted to warning, the model
# will not build. Until the code can be fixed, for now we set the flags to
# convert to warnings. But by using an option() we can allow this to be
# turned off for testing.
